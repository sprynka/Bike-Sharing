# Bike-Sharing Prediction Model
### Forecasted number of bike rentals in a region using Python for better inventory planning

The goal of this exercise is to examine bike rentals within a specific location to determine whether forecasting at a granular level will isolate factors influencing two customer types: casual users (first-time users) and registered users (subscribed, long-term customers).

A variety of machine learning techniques were applied to collected data to isolate factors useful for predicting rentals across months for financial and operational forecasting and by times of day for more granular inventory and maintenance planning. The initial approach examined total user forecasting based on a variety of variables. Through the resulting analysis, we found that the two distinct user groups, Registered and Casual, should be examined separately due to different profiles.

Based on our findings, we believe that we can create a financial and operational forecasting tool that accounts for differences in predictive factors between these two user groups. Other uses beyond financial modeling include inventory and maintenance planning by isolating factors that indicate lower short-term and long-term use, reducing the amount of down time during peak periods. Additionally, we believe that we can utilize different marketing timing between the two groups to target them when they are mostly likely to engage with the product.
